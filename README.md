# Webber's Map Editor 2D

⚠️ Pre-alpha, works but doesn't do much yet. ⚠️

## How it works

- Load or create a new map
- Select your sprites' folder (recursively). 
- Drag your sprites to the canvas to create instances.
- On the canvas, adjust instances:
  - 📛 Name 
  - 🪧 Position (x, y)
  - 🔝 Z-Index
  - 🛞 Rotation
  - 🔛 Scale
- Save map as a JSON file (includes relative paths to the files).
